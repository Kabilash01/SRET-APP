# The SRET Faculty Management Application: SOP or Technical blueprint

## Project Goal

The SRET Faculty Management Application is a centralized, mobile-first platform for Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, designed to automate academic operations. Its primary purpose is to reduce administrative overhead and streamline critical workflows like leave management and class substitutions, creating a more efficient and connected academic environment.

## Introduction & Vision

**User Roles**:
- **Faculty**: Submit leave requests, manage class swaps, respond to substitution requests
- **Head of Department (HOD)**: Approve requests, monitor live classes, oversee departmental operations  
- **Dean/Vice Dean**: Access strategic analytics, monitor institution-wide operations
- **Administrator**: Manage users, timetables, and system configurations

## System Architecture & Technology Stack

### Architecture Overview
- **Model**: Client-server architecture
- **Frontend**: Flutter mobile application
- **Backend**: Supabase Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
- **Admin Panel**: Flutter web application hosted on Vercel

### Frontend (Client) - Flutter

**Core Dependencies**:
- **supabase_flutter**: Supabase service integration (auth, real-time, database)
- **flutter_riverpod**: State management for predictable app state
- **go_router**: Declarative routing with nested routes and deep linking
- **flutter_secure_storage**: Platform-native secure storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- **dio**: HTTP client with interceptors and error handling
- **firebase_messaging**: Push notification integration

### Backend & Hosting - Supabase

**Components**:
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed database with backups and connection pooling
- **Auto-Generated APIs**: REST/GraphQL APIs from database schema
- **Integrated Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for business logic and integrations

## Authentication & Security

### Authentication Strategy

**No Public Sign-Up**: Only administrators can create user accounts (Faculty, HOD, Dean, etc.)

**Three Login Methods**:

1. **Employee ID + Password**:
   - Admin creates faculty with Employee ID and @sret.edu.in email
   - System sends secure "Set Password" email link for initial password creation
   - First login forces users to set new password.
   - Further logins , faculty uses their set password.

2. **Google Sign-In**: One-click OAuth login using institutional @sret.edu.in Google accounts

3. **Passwordless Email Magic Link**: Users receive secure, one-time login links via email.

### Session Management

**JWT + Refresh Token Strategy**:

**Access Token**:
- **Algorithm**: HS256 with secret key
- **Validity**: 10 minutes 
- **Payload Claims**:

| Claim | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| sub | UUID | User unique ID | "a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11" |
| role | String | User system role | "faculty", "hod", "dean", "admin" |
| dept_id | Integer | Department ID | 101 |
| iat | Timestamp | Issued at | 1692547200 |
| exp | Timestamp | Expires at | 1692548100 |

**Refresh Token**:
- **Validity**: 7 days
- **Rotation**: Mandatory single-use tokens with automatic renewal

**Automatic Token Refresh**:
- **Token refresh**: Handle 401 errors and automatic token refresh
- **Seamless Experience**: Users never see login prompts during active sessions

### API Security Headers

| Header | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Authorization | Bearer token | "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." |
| Apikey | Supabase project key | "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." |
| X-Request-ID | Request tracing | "req_1692547200_abc123" |
| X-Client-Version | Forced update control | "v1.2.3" |

### Database Security
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level firewall on every table
- **Example**: Faculty sees only their data using `uid() = faculty_id` policies
- **Department Filtering**: HODs see only their department data automatically

## Functional Modules & Workflows

### Faculty Module

#### Home Dashboard

**What Faculty Experience**:
When faculty open the app, they see a main screen with a big card showing their next class and a list of all their classes for today. Each class card shows if it’s a Lab, Theory, or Project, but doesn’t show extra details like the section to keep things simple. The app also works like a personal assistant, giving smart reminders for upcoming classes.

**Custom Notifications**:
- Faculty set preferred reminder times (5, 10, or 15 minutes before class)
- "Snooze" option when notification arrives but faculty is busy
- Notifications include class context and one-tap navigation to details

#### Timetable View

**What Faculty See**:
Toggle between "Day View" (today's classes) and "Week View" (7-day overview) showing complete class details including time, subject, room, and course type. Clean, calendar-style interface with color coding for different course types.

#### Leave Management

**What Faculty Can Do**:
Apply for three types of leave with intelligent impact preview:
- **Full Day**: Entire day off
- **Half Day**: Morning or afternoon sessions
- **Specific Periods**: Individual class periods

Before submitting, the app automatically shows exactly which classes will be affected.

#### Substitution Management

**What Faculty Experience**:
Receive push notifications for substitution opportunities with complete context: subject, time, room, semester, section, and priority level explanation. One-tap accept/decline with optional notes for special instructions.

**The Intelligent Waterfall Logic**:

1. **Priority 1 - Same Semester Teaching Team**: 
   - Faculty teaching other subjects to the same student group
   - Example: For B.Tech AIDA Sem 1 Chemistry absence → notify Maths, Physics, English faculty

2. **Priority 2 - Same Department**: 
   - Any free faculty within the same department (e.g., AIDA department)
   - Faculty familiar with department policies and student groups

3. **Priority 3 - Cross Departments**: 
   - Search faculty in other departments who are free to take up substitutions.

#### Faculty-to-Faculty Class Swapping

**What Faculty Can Do**:
Request direct class exchanges with colleagues teaching the same student group. Faculty can propose swapping specific classes, add reasoning, and track approval status.

- Class swaps: If a faculty member is busy during a particular class, they can request another teacher to take their class for that period. Later, to balance attendance and teaching hours, the app will intelligently suggest a suitable class for the original teacher to take in return, ensuring both teachers have equal class hours.

#### Settings & Preferences

**Available Configurations**:
- **Substitution Opt-in**: Toggle availability for substitution requests
- **Appearance**: Light/Dark mode selection
- **Calendar Sync**: Export personal schedule to Google Calendar
- **Do Not Disturb**: Set quiet hours for notifications
- **Reminder Timing**: Customize class reminder preferences

### HOD Module

#### HOD Dashboard (Department-Specific)

**What HODs Monitor**:
Real-time departmental dashbaord view:

**Dashbaord components**:

- **Pending Approvals**: Queue of leave/swap requests awaiting decision

**Now Teaching Section**:
- Real-time list of active classes with faculty status
- **VACANT** slots highlighted for immediate attention
- Tap any class to see details, message faculty, or take emergency action
- **Manual Allocation**: Assign free faculty to vacant classes instantly

#### Leave & Swap Approvals

**What HODs Do**:
- **One-Tap Approval**: Quick approve/reject with optional reasoning for rejections
- **Impact Analysis**: See exactly which classes and students affected
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple requests efficiently

#### Substitution Console

**HOD Monitoring Role**:
- **Automated Oversight**: Monitor the waterfall substitution process in real-time
- **Intervention Points**: Receive alerts when automation fails at any priority level

2. **Department Selection**: Select specific department to monitor
3. **HOD Dashboard Access**: View any department's HOD dashboard with full context

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Hierarchical Filtering**: Progressive data filtering from institution → program → department
- **Context Switching**: Maintain user's navigation path for easy back-navigation
- **Permission Inheritance**: Full access to all HOD-level functions

#### Analytics Dashboard

**Strategic Intelligence**:
- **Institution-wide KPIs**: Total classes, leave rates, approval metrics
